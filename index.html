                        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by
                        Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's
                        Grand
                        Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San
                        Andreas,
                        based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank
                        robber
                        Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin Clinton (Shawn Fonteno), and drug dealer
                        and
                        gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure
                        from
                        a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world
                        countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.</h3>

                        Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor Philips.[34]
                        Rockstar North began to develop Grand Theft Auto V in 2008, around Grand Theft Auto IV's
                        release.[35] The development team totalled more than 1,000 people, including Rockstar North's
                        core
                        team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games' studios around the world.[36] The proprietary
                        Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw distance
                        rendering capabilities.[37] The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and
                        rendering tasks.[38] Having become familiar with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware over
                        time,
                        Rockstar found they were able to push the consoles' graphical capabilities further than in
                        previous
                        games.[39] Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at
                        more
                        than £170 million (US$265 million), which would make it the most expensive game ever made at
                        that
                        time.[40][l]

                            Rockstar Games announced the game on 25 October 2011.[56] They released its debut trailer
                            one
                            week
                            later,[57] with an official press release acknowledging its setting.[58] Journalists noted
                            the
                            widespread industry anticipation ignited by the announcement, which they owed to the series'
                            cultural significance.[59][60][61] The game missed its original projected Q2 2013 release
                            date,
                            pushed back to 17 September to allow for further polishing.[62] To spur pre-order game
                            sales,
                            Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to make a special edition with extra
                            in-game
                            features.[63] They ran a viral marketing strategy with a website for a fictional religious
                            cult,
